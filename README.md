Grid-Engine-Prolog-Scripts
==========================

Some prolog/epilog Scripts we use with   Grid engine on our cluster.
This includes the scripts for locking/allocating GPU written by Andreas Roussos 
and the infrastructure for faking a parallel prolog/epilog and calling subscripts written by me.
